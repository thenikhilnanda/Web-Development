# Web-Development
"This repository contains my web technology and web development projects, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. 
The projects showcase my skills in creating responsive and dynamic websites, and demonstrate my understanding of web development concepts such as web design, accessibility, and user experience. Feel free to explore the projects and use them as a reference for your own web development work.
